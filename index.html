                        Alaska Moose are the largest deer species in the world. These animals are found in the boreal forests 
                        of Alaska and Canada. An Alaska Moose can weigh between 400-700 kg, and their large antlers are their 
                        most distinguishing feature. They primarily feed on grass, shrubs, and aquatic plants.

                        Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are known for their massive size, long trunks, 
                        and large ears that help regulate their body temperature. Elephants are primarily found in Africa 
                        and Asia, inhabiting grasslands, forests, and savannas. They can weigh between 2,000-6,000 kg and 
                        mainly feed on grass, fruits, and bark. Elephants are highly intelligent and social animals, living in 
                        close-knit herds led by a matriarch.

                        Leopards are one of the most adaptable and stealthy big cats, known for their striking spotted coats. 
                        They are found across Africa, Asia, and parts of the Middle East, thriving in diverse habitats like 
                        forests, grasslands, and mountains. Leopards weigh between 30-90 kg and are excellent climbers, often 
                        dragging their prey into trees for safety. They primarily feed on small to medium-sized animals and 
                        are renowned for their ability to hunt silently and efficiently.
